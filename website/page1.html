<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  With all the fire and fury fans have come to expect from internationally bestselling author George R. R. Martin, this
  is the first volume of the definitive two-part history of the Targaryens in Westeros.

  Centuries before the events of A Game of Thrones, House Targaryen—the only family of dragonlords to survive the Doom
  of Valyria—took up residence on Dragonstone. Fire and Blood begins their tale with the legendary Aegon the Conqueror,
  creator of the Iron Throne, and goes on to recount the generations of Targaryens who fought to hold that iconic seat,
  all the way up to the civil war that nearly tore their dynasty apart.

  What really happened during the Dance of the Dragons? Why did it become so deadly to visit Valyria after the Doom?
  What is the origin of Daenerys’s three dragon eggs? These are but a few of the questions answered in this essential
  chronicle, as related by a learned maester of the Citadel and featuring more than eighty all-new black-and-white
  illustrations by artist Doug Wheatley. Readers have glimpsed small parts of this narrative in such volumes as The
  World of Ice & Fire, but now, for the first time, the full tapestry of Targaryen history is revealed.

  With all the scope and grandeur of Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Fire and Blood is
  the ultimate game of thrones, giving readers a whole new appreciation for the dynamic, often bloody, and always
  fascinating history of Westeros.

  Collins Martin, a longshoreman, and his mother was Margaret Brady Martin. He has two sisters, Darleen Martin Lapinski
  and Janet Martin Patten.

  Martin attended Mary Jane Donohoe School and Marist High School. He began writing very young, selling monster stories
  to other neighborhood children for pennies, dramatic readings included. Later he became a comic book fan and collector
  in high school, and began to write fiction for comic fanzines (amateur fan magazines). Martin's first professional
  sale was made in 1970 at age 21: The Hero, sold to Galaxy, published in February, 1971 issue. Other sales followed.

  In 1970 Martin received a B.S. in Journalism from Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, graduating summa cum
  laude. He went on to complete a M.S. in Journalism in 1971, also from Northwestern.

  As a conscientious objector, Martin did alternative service 1972-1974 with VISTA, attached to Cook County Legal
  Assistance Foundation. He also directed chess tournaments for the Continental Chess Association from 1973-1976, and
  was a Journalism instructor at Clarke College, Dubuque, Iowa, from 1976-1978. He wrote part-time throughout the 1970s
  while working as a VISTA Volunteer, chess director, and teacher.

  In 1975 he married Gale Burnick. They divorced in 1979, with no children. Martin became a full-time writer in 1979. He
  was writer-in-residence at Clarke College from 1978-79.

  Moving on to Hollywood, Martin signed on as a story editor for Twilight Zone at CBS Television in 1986. In 1987 Martin
  became an Executive Story Consultant for Beauty and the Beast at CBS. In 1988 he became a Producer for Beauty and the
  Beast, then in 1989 moved up to Co-Supervising Producer. He was Executive Producer for Doorways, a pilot which he
  wrote for Columbia Pictures Television, which was filmed during 1992-93.

  Martin's present home is Santa Fe, New Mexico. He is a member of Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America (he was
  South-Central Regional Director 1977-1979, and Vice President 1996-1998), and of Writers' Guild of America, West.
